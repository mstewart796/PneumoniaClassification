# Pneumonia Detection CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. 

**Note:** The current results are based on an initial round of training and will be improved with further fine-tuning and training.

### Current Training Results:
- **Validation Accuracy**: 78.99%
- **Validation Precision**: 67.52%
- **Validation Recall**: 13.06%
- **Confusion Matrix**:
  ```
  [[2041,   38],
   [ 526,   79]]
  ```

Further updates to the notebook and README, including more detailed comments and explanations, will follow as the model is improved.
